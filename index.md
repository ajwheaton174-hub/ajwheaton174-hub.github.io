**Determinants of India's Economic Growth: An Econometric Analysis**

Abstract: This paper analyzes the determinants of India’s economic growth since independence through a **time-series** study. The study explores how key variables–such as trade, population, index of democratization, and age dependency ratio–have contributed to India’s emergence as a global economic power. Drawing on decades of data, it traces the transformation of India’s growth trajectory through liberalization and globalization. By analyzing the drivers of India’s 
economic growth, this study provides insights into India’s evolving economic model and its 
implications for the future dynamics of the global economy.
